# FizzBuzz kata

Imagine the scene. You are eleven years old, and in the five minutes before the
end of the lesson, your Math teacher decides she should make her class more
“fun” by introducing a “game”. She explains that she is going to point at each
pupil in turn and ask them to say the next number in sequence, starting from
one. The “fun” part is that if the number is divisible by three, you instead
say “Fizz” and if it is divisible by five you say “Buzz”. So now your math
teacher is pointing at all of your classmates in turn, and they happily shout
“one!”, “two!”, “Fizz!”, “four!”, “Buzz!”… until she very deliberately points
at you, fixing you with a steely gaze… time stands still, your mouth dries up,
your palms become sweatier and sweatier until you finally manage to croak
“Fizz!”. Doom is avoided, and the pointing finger moves on.

So of course in order to avoid embarassment in front of your whole class, you
have to get the full list printed out so you know what to say. Your class has
about 33 pupils and she might go round three times before the bell rings for
break time. Next math lesson is on Thursday. Get coding!

## Requirements

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of
three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print
“Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
“FizzBuzz“.

## Example

- 1 => 1
- 2 => 2
- 3 => Fizz
- 4 => 4
- 5 => Buzz
- 6 => Fizz
- 7 => 7
- 8 => 8
- 9 => Fizz
- 10 => Buzz
- 15 => FizzBuzz
